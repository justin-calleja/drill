What questions might you want answers to?

- Which are the weakest 5 items?
- Which items *depend on* item x?
- What is the definition of *depend on* for items?
- Which items *relate to* item x?
- What is the definition of *relate to* for items?


NOTE: current way of generating ids is flawed because if you have the same question in a file,
you get the same id. (is this a flaw? - it is the same question after all).
